<img src="images/loginAndItemAdd.gif?raw=true"/>
#### Description
This is an app that helps users take care of their economy<br/>
Users can make an acount and thereafter join/create up to 4 groups<br/>
Each group keeps track of its users economy by calculating<br/>
the total amount spent this month and what items that the users have<br/>
bought. This information is represented with graphs and tables<br/>
This app also lets users automaticly calculate how much each user<br/>
have spent so that users easily can keep track that every member of<br/>
a specific group pays evenly each month. The app stores all information<br/>
in a database so that users can go back and see how much they spent during
previous months<br/>
